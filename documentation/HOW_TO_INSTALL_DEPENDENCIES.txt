This readme outlines how to install dependencies and run basic code.

Dependencies:
  Numpy
  OpenCV
  PIL
  pyFLANN
  SciPy
  httplib
  SIFTDemo

On a Ubuntu machine, most of the dependencies can be installed using this command:

	$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-opencv python-imaging python-scipy python-httplib2 build-essential git-core

To install pyFLANN, download and follow the instructions here:

	http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/FLANN

You also need a SIFT extractor, which can be downloaded from Lowe's web page. Once downloaded, hard code the path to the sift demo executable in project/src/client.py as the SIFT_EXEC variable.

How to run python code:
NOTE: the python portion of this project is intended to be run from a linux machine
-if executable: python [executable].py [args]
-if not:  python
          import [filename]
          [filename].[methodname]([args])
          [ctrl-d to exit python interpreter when done]
    
See the mini-tutorial in QueryTutorial.pdf for information on how to setup a basic image query pipeline from scratch.
